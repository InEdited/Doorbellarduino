# Doorbellarduino
Arduino project that replaces my doorbell tone for the full Megalovainia sound track.

Speaker's input is pin 8 and doorbell button is 5

My doorbell worked on a 220VAC so I had to use a rectefier circuit which powers the speaker through a transistor as well as power for the arduino and a relay for the arduino input.

> Just figured out I don't even need a relay or a button input I can always just play the melody as long as there's power going to the arduino so yea
Will make a full schematic later
